Redesign the existing ASP.NET WebForms project to a modern architecture using Angular for the user interface, .NET API for backend services, and Oracle as the database. The new design will ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface, improved performance, and maintainability. Key tasks include developing Angular components and services, implementing RESTful APIs in .NET, and optimizing database interactions with Oracle. The project will follow a modular approach, ensuring scalability and separation of concerns across the frontend, backend, and database layers
