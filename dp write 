Acceptance Criteria

Frontend Tasks (Angular UI)

1. Create UI for Adding New Records

Scenario: User creates a new record.

Given: The user has proper permissions to create a record and is on the "Create" form.

When: The user fills in all required fields with valid data and clicks the "Save" button.

Then: The record is saved in the database, and the UI refreshes to display the new record.

And: A success message is displayed to the user.

And: If the input is invalid, error messages are displayed for the invalid fields.

Scenario: User updates an existing record.

Given: The user has proper permissions to edit a record and clicks the "Edit" button for a specific record.

When: The user modifies the fields and clicks the "Update" button.

Then: The record is updated in the database, and the UI reflects the changes.

And: A success message is displayed to the user.




3. Create Delete Confirmation Dialog

Scenario: User deletes a record.

Given: The user has proper permissions to delete a record and clicks the "Delete" button.

When: The user confirms the deletion in the confirmation dialog.

Then: The record is deleted from the database, and the UI no longer displays it.

And: A success message is displayed to the user.




4. Role-Based Access Control for UI Actions

Scenario: Role-based permissions for UI actions.

Given: The user is logged in with a specific role.

When: The user accesses the application.

Then: The "Create," "Edit," and "Delete" buttons are only visible to authorized users.




5. Add Success and Error Notifications

Scenario: Notifications after a write operation.

Given: The user performs a write operation (create, update, or delete).

When: The operation is completed successfully or fails.

Then: A success or error message is displayed, respectively.

Backend Tasks (.NET API)

6. Implement POST Endpoint

Scenario: API handles record creation.

Given: The client sends a valid POST request to create a record.

When: The API processes the request.

Then: The record is created in the database, and a 201 Created response is returned.

And: If the input is invalid, a 400 Bad Request response is returned with error details.




7. Implement PUT Endpoint

Scenario: API handles record updates.

Given: The client sends a valid PUT request to update a record.

When: The API processes the request.

Then: The record is updated in the database, and a 200 OK response is returned.

And: If the record does not exist, a 404 Not Found response is returned.




8. Implement DELETE Endpoint

Scenario: API handles record deletion.

Given: The client sends a valid DELETE request for an existing record.

When: The API processes the request.

Then: The record is removed from the database, and a 204 No Content response is returned.

And: If the record does not exist, a 404 Not Found response is returned.




9. Secure Write Endpoints

Scenario: API enforces security for write operations.

Given: An unauthorized or unauthenticated user attempts to perform a write operation.

When: The API receives the request.

Then: A 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden response is returned.




10. Add Logging for Write Operations



Scenario: Write operations are logged.

Given: A user performs a Create, Update, or Delete operation.

When: The operation is processed by the API.

Then: The operation details (e.g., user, timestamp, operation type) are logged using Splunk.

Testing Tasks

11. Write Unit Tests for Angular Components



Scenario: Validate Angular component behavior.

Given: The application is tested using a testing framework (e.g., Jasmine or Karma).

When: Unit tests are executed.

Then: All components achieve at least 80% test coverage.



12. Write Unit Tests for .NET API Endpoints



Scenario: Validate API endpoints.

Given: The API endpoints are tested using a testing framework (e.g., xUnit or NUnit).

When: Unit tests are executed.

Then: All write endpoints achieve at least 80% test coverage.



13. Conduct Integration Testing



Scenario: Verify end-to-end write operations.

Given: The Angular UI, .NET API, and database are deployed in a test environment.

When: Integration tests are executed.

Then: All workflows for create, update, and delete operations pass successfully.
