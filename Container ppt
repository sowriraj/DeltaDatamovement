Slide 1: Title SlideTitle: OpenShift BasicsSubtitle: An Introduction to OpenShiftAuthor: [Your Name]Date: [Date]Slide 2: What is OpenShift?OpenShift is a Kubernetes platform by Red Hat.It provides a foundation to build and deploy containerized applications.Supports DevOps principles for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).Slide 3: Key Features of OpenShiftIntegrated Development Environment: Tools and services for building applications.Scalability: Automatically scale applications up or down.Self-Healing: Automatically replaces failed components.Security: Built-in security features for container orchestration.Slide 4: OpenShift ArchitectureMaster Nodes: Manage the OpenShift cluster.Worker Nodes: Run applications and containers.Etcd: A key-value store for configuration and state data.Networking: OpenShift SDN for communication between pods.Slide 5: OpenShift vs KubernetesBuilt-in CI/CD Tools: OpenShift provides integrated Jenkins pipelines.Security Enhancements: Security Context Constraints (SCCs) and Red Hat support.User Interface: More user-friendly web console.Developer Experience: Source-to-Image (S2I) for easy application builds.Slide 6: OpenShift ComponentsOpenShift Container Platform (OCP): Core enterprise-grade Kubernetes.OpenShift Origin (OKD): Community distribution of Kubernetes.OpenShift Online: Hosted OpenShift service.OpenShift Dedicated: Managed service on the cloud.Slide 7: Installation OptionsOn-Premises: Deploy on physical or virtual servers.Public Cloud: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure.Hybrid: Combination of on-premises and cloud deployments.Slide 8: Basic ConceptsProjects: Isolated groups of applications and resources.Pods: Smallest deployable units of computing.Services: Expose and load-balance pods.Routes: Expose services to external networks.Slide 9: Working with OpenShift CLI (oc)Login: oc loginCreate Project: oc new-project <project-name>Deploy Application: oc new-app <source>Manage Resources: oc get pods, oc delete pod <pod-name>Slide 10: OpenShift Web ConsoleUser-friendly interface for managing projects, applications, and resources.Visualize application deployments and status.Easy access to logs and metrics.Slide 11: CI/CD with OpenShiftPipelines: Automated workflows for building, testing, and deploying applications.Jenkins Integration: Use Jenkins for CI/CD tasks.GitOps: Use Git repositories as the source of truth for deployments.Slide 12: Security in OpenShiftRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): Manage permissions.Security Context Constraints (SCCs): Define security rules for pods.Network Policies: Control traffic between pods.Slide 13: Monitoring and LoggingPrometheus: Monitoring and alerting toolkit.Grafana: Visualization and dashboarding.Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana (EFK) Stack: Centralized logging.Slide 14: Common Use CasesMicroservices Architecture: Manage microservices applications.Development and Testing: Streamline development workflows.Data Processing: Run big data and AI/ML workloads.Slide 15: ConclusionOpenShift enhances Kubernetes with additional tools and features.Supports modern application development practices.Flexible deployment options for various environments.Slide 16: Q&AOpen the floor for questions and discussions.Would you like me to create this presentation as a PowerPoint file for you?
