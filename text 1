Got it! Here's a clear Epic Design, broken down with description, features, and acceptance criteria for your internal integrated website release — including moving from dark to production and OpenShift vulnerability fixes.

Epic Title:

Release Internal Integrated Web Portal to Production with Vulnerability Fixes


---

Epic Description:

This epic focuses on releasing the internal integrated web portal from dark launch to full production. It includes enabling all integrated internal applications for end-users and addressing container-level vulnerabilities in the OpenShift deployment environment. The release must ensure stability, security, and readiness for production use.


---

Key Features/Stories in the Epic:

1. Dark Launch Verification

Validate integrated app performance and user flows in the dark environment.

Collect internal feedback before going live.



2. Security Fixes Implementation

Address OpenShift container vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs, outdated libraries).

Apply best practices for container hardening.



3. CI/CD Readiness

Ensure pipelines are updated to deploy secure, verified builds to production.



4. Monitoring & Alerts Setup

Ensure all services have logs and health monitoring configured pre-prod.



5. Production Release

Enable all integrated applications for production use.

Ensure rollback strategy is in place.

Acceptance Criteria (Given–When–Then):

1. Dark Launch Completion

Given the integrated internal site is dark-launched

When it is accessed by internal users

Then all apps must load correctly, and no critical issues should be reported



2. Security Fixes Applied

Given known OpenShift container vulnerabilities

When the updated images are built and deployed

Then no critical or high vulnerabilities should remain as per latest scan



3. Monitoring & Logging

Given the site is moving to production

When any service fails or logs errors

Then alerts should be triggered and logs should be visible in centralized logging



4. Production Deployment

Given dark launch feedback is addressed

When the production toggle is turned on

Then all internal users should access the portal without issue



5. Rollback Plan

Given the production deployment fails

When rollback is triggered

Then the system should return to its last stable state with minimal disruption

Would you like me to break this down into individual JIRA stories or give you a Confluence-ready format?
