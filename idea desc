Problem Description

In the current internal website, users need to manually navigate to the ARM portal to raise a ticket for "Revoke" and "Reinstate" actions in the Access Check module. This process is time-consuming, requires multiple steps, and disrupts the user workflow. Additionally, manually raising tickets can lead to errors, delays, and inefficiencies in access management.

Proposed Solution

Integrate the ARM ticket creation process directly into the Access Check module of the internal website. When a user clicks the Revoke or Reinstate button, the application will automatically generate and submit an ARM ticket in the background without requiring manual intervention in the ARM portal.

Implementation Approach

1. UI Enhancement

Add "Revoke" and "Reinstate" buttons in the Access Check module.

Provide a confirmation popup before triggering the request.



2. Backend Integration

Develop an API that communicates with the ARM system to create tickets programmatically.

The API should handle necessary authentication and authorization.

Capture and store ticket details such as ticket ID, status, and timestamps.



3. Workflow Automation

When a user clicks the button, the system should:

Validate user permissions.

Collect required details for the ticket.

Submit a request to the ARM system via API.

Update the UI with the ticket status.




4. Logging and Notifications

Log all ticket creation attempts for auditing.

Notify users via email or UI notification once the ticket is raised.




This solution will streamline the ticketing process, improve efficiency, and enhance user experience by reducing manual efforts.
