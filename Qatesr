Here’s the separate acceptance criteria for QA testing and performance testing, along with the modules that need to be tested:

QA Testing Acceptance Criteria

Scenario: Validating the quality and functionality of the new internal website.

Modules to be Tested:

User Authentication (Login/Logout)

Dashboard

User Profile Management

Notifications and Alerts

Data Input Forms

Reporting and Analytics



Case 1: Testing core functionality.

Given that the QA team has access to the latest build of the website,

When each module (e.g., authentication, profile management) is tested for proper functionality,

Then the modules should behave as expected with no critical bugs or errors.


Case 2: Validating cross-browser compatibility.

Given that the website supports multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge),

When the website is tested across different browsers and devices,

Then it should function consistently and display correctly in all supported environments.


Case 3: Ensuring proper error handling.

Given that the QA team simulates various input errors and system failures,

When these scenarios are tested,

Then the system should handle them gracefully by displaying appropriate error messages without crashing.

Performance Testing Acceptance Criteria

Scenario: Ensuring the website can handle expected user load and performs well under stress.

Modules to be Tested:

Homepage Loading

Search Functionality

Data Reports (Generating and Exporting)

User Profile Update

High-traffic pages (e.g., Dashboard, Notifications)



Case 1: Testing website response time.

Given that performance testing tools are set up,

When the response time is measured under normal user load,

Then all critical pages should load within 3 seconds under normal conditions.


Case 2: Stress testing under peak traffic.

Given that stress testing scenarios are defined to simulate peak user traffic,

When the website is tested under high load (e.g., 500 concurrent users),

Then the system should remain stable without crashing or significant performance degradation.


Case 3: Resource utilization (CPU, Memory).

Given that resource usage is monitored during performance testing,

When the site operates under varying loads,

Then CPU and memory usage should remain within acceptable limits, and the website should not cause server overload.


These criteria ensure both functional correctness (QA) and the system’s ability to handle real-world demands (performance).
