​​To ensure comprehensive performance and quality assurance (QA) testing for the new internal website, the following acceptance criteria are established:​​

Scenario: ​​Conducting performance and QA testing for the new internal website.​​

Case 1: ​​Testing during the current release cycle.​​

Given ​​that the November release was a dark release due to technical challenges,​​

When ​​the current release cycle commences,​​

Then ​​performance and QA testing for the new internal website should be conducted within this release.​​


Case 2: ​​Addressing issues identified during testing.​​

Given ​​that performance and QA testing are underway for the new internal website,​​

When ​​issues or defects are identified during testing,​​

Then ​​these issues should be documented, prioritized, and addressed before the release is finalized.​​


Case 3: ​​Ensuring readiness for public release.​​

Given ​​that performance and QA testing have been completed,​​

When ​​all identified issues have been resolved and the website meets the defined quality standards,​​

Then ​​the new internal website should be approved for public release.​​


​​These acceptance criteria ensure that the new internal website undergoes thorough testing in the current release cycle, addressing any issues before public deployment.​​​​
